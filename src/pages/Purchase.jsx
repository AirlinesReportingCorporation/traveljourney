        <p>When a customer decides to book a ticket through a travel agency, an order is created. Today, the GDS creates the order based on input from the airline and travel agency. As a result, a ticket, passenger name record (PNR) and reservation are created and relayed to the airline and travel agency.

    } else if (drawerContent == "payment") {
      drawerContent = <div>
        <div className="payment">Payment</div>
        <p>The traveler provides the agency with a form of payment — cash or credit card. ARC facilitates this payment to ensure it’s delivered to the airline.</p>
        <p>In the future, tickets will be replaced by orders, which can contain any number of service items: tickets for multiple people, airline ancillary purchases, and presumably third-party products (e.g., rideshare credits).</p>
        <div><img className="chartIMG" src="img/paymentChartBIG.png" alt="Order Creation"/></div>
      </div>;
    } else if (drawerContent == "settlement") {
      drawerContent = <div>
        <div className="settlement">Settlement</div>
        <p>ARC facilitates the settlement process between thousands of travel agencies and hundreds of airlines. If the payment is in cash, ARC deducts that amount from the travel agency’s bank account. If it’s a credit card payment, ARC initiates the credit card billing, and the credit card brand delivers that amount to the airline.</p>
        <p>ARC’s position as an industry connector gives it a unique, industrywide view of payment, pricing and travel trends. The global travel community relies on this data to effectively benchmark their performance, create new travel routes and build better relationships with industry partners.</p>
        <div><img className="chartIMG" src="img/settlementChartBIG.png" alt="Order Creation"/></div>
      </div>;
    } else if (drawerContent == "oneorder") {
      drawerContent = <div>
        <div className="drawerTitle oneorder">ONE Order</div>
        <p>Today, air travel purchases in the agency channel are fragmented. The airline ticket transaction is separate from baggage fees, in-flight wi-fi, lounge access and other ancillary purchases — all of which are systematically treated as individual tickets.
        </p>
        <p>ONE Order will create a consolidated order structure that brings together disparate purchase data in a centralized location.
        </p>
        <p>In the future, tickets will be replaced by orders, which can contain any number of service items: tickets for multiple people, airline ancillary purchases, and presumably third-party products (e.g., rideshare credits).</p>
